Sample 2
======================

The second sample extends the FIFA championship site adding the beginnings of Bootstrap.

# Getting Started

Open the ``index.html`` file in your favorite browser.  You may also open the ``schedule.html`` page.

# What Changed

This sample essentially adds the required CSS files and the required JS files including jQuery which is required by Bootstrap.  Reloading and comparing this to sample1 is fairly similar with the exception of the fonts and better borders on tables.  It is the beginning to making the site more consistent and user friendly.
