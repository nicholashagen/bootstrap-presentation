Sample 4
======================

The fifth and final sample provides an alternate style to the site by grouping the standings into tabs instead of columns.

# Getting Started

Open the ``index.html`` file in your favorite browser.  You may also open the ``schedule.html`` page.

# What Changed

This sample uses the Bootstrap tab component to provide each group standings in its own tab.  The HTML is mostly the same except that the groups are contained within tab panes and a new set of navigation links is provided inside the tabs.  The key is that no CSS or JS was required.  The page just flows automatically.
