Sample 4
======================

The fourth sample cleans up the tables and buttons to further beautify them.

# Getting Started

Open the ``index.html`` file in your favorite browser.  You may also open the ``schedule.html`` page.

# What Changed

This sample first uses the ``pull-left`` and ``pull-right`` classes to align the group title and schedule link in one line.

The biggest change is using the variety of CSS classes to manage the tables.  The ``table-bordered`` class essentially adds column borders.  Otherwise, you would only get row borders which is also a great look.  The ``table-striped`` class provides row striping alternating rows between white and gray.  Finally, the ``table-hover`` class makes a row appear gray when hovering over it.

Another minor change is using the CSS class ``success`` to make the top team in each group stand out in a green background.  The ``error``, ``warning``, ``info``, etc classes could have also been used to assign a red, yellow, blue, etc styles, respectively.

The schedule page uses the button styles in Bootstrap to provide much richer looking buttons.  The reset buttons use the ``btn-danger`` class to provide a red background on the button to provide a visual note to the user that the button may be destructive.  This, in itself, provides a much more user friendly site.
